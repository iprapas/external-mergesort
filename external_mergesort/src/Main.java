 *
 * In this assignment we are asked to implement an external-memory merge-sort algorithm
 * and examine its performance under different parameters.
 *
 * As a warm-up exercise we explore several different ways to read data from,
 * and write data to secondary memory. The overall goal of the assignment
 * is to get real-world experience with the performance of external-memory algorithms.
